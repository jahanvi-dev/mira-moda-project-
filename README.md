Hey, <br>
If you are short on time just visit the link - https://jahanvi-dev.github.io/mira-moda-project-1/ <br>
Thanks for visiting my page, Mira Moda is one of my first big project I have tried creating from scratch by myself it was quite a challenge but i have finally built it. For this project my first priority wasn't my design but more of JavaScript. This project is made using vanilla js, for rendering data i have used api & dom manipulation. <br>
If you have some suggestion feel free to reach out, and drop your suggestions & guides.
